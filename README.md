## 1]COUNTER USING D-FF

This project implements a binary counter using D flip-flops in Verilog HDL, designed and simulated in Xilinx Vivado. The counter increments its value on each rising edge of the clock signal and is capable of counting through a predefined sequence (e.g., 3-bit or 4-bit range). D flip-flops are used as the basic building blocks to store and propagate the binary count values synchronously.

The design was tested using Vivadoâ€™s simulation environment to verify correct counting behavior and proper reset functionality. Each flip-flop stage captures the output of a defined logic function, forming a ripple or synchronous counter depending on configuration.

Below is the image for schematic counter using D-ff in Xilinx Vivado.

## 2] 3-BIT MULTIPLIER USING HALF ADDER

This project implements a 3-bit binary multiplier using Half Adders and basic logic gates, written in Verilog HDL and simulated in Xilinx Vivado. The multiplier takes two 3-bit binary inputs and produces a 6-bit product through a combination of partial product generation and binary addition using Half Adders.

The architecture mimics the traditional method of multiplication, where each bit of one operand is multiplied with the other operand to form partial products, which are then summed using Half Adders to generate the final result.This project demonstrates how basic arithmetic operations like multiplication can be built from the ground up using fundamental logic components.
